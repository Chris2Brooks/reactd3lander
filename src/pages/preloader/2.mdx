## Step 1: Get the image

Download
[my screenshot from Github](https://github.com/Swizec/react-d3-walkthrough-livecode/raw/master/src/assets/preloading.png)
and save it in `src/assets/preloading.png`. It goes in the `src/assets/`
directory because we're going to `import` it in JavaScript (which makes it part
of our source code), and I like to put non-JavaScript files in `assets`. Keeps
the project organized.
