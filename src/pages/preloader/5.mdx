## Step 4: Load Bootstrap styles

We're going to use Bootstrap styles to avoid reinventing the wheel. We're
ignoring their JavaScript widgets and the amazing integration built by the
[react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) team. Just the
stylesheets please.

They'll make our fonts look better, help with layouting, and make buttons look
like buttons. We _could_ use styled components, but writing our own styles
detracts from this tutorial.

We load stylesheets in `src/index.js`.

```{.javascript caption="Add Bootstrap in index.js"}
// src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
// Insert the line(s) between here...
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
// ...and here.

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Another benefit of Webpack: `import`-ing stylesheets. These imports turn into
`<style>` tags with CSS in their body at runtime.

This is also a good opportunity to see how `index.js` works to render our app
:point_down:

1. loads `App` and React
2. loads styles
3. Uses `ReactDOM` to render `<App />` into the DOM

That's it.

Your preloader screen should look better now.
