It's a donut chart that transitions to a bar chart. Same component, same React
code, different radius. 29,905px instead of 728px. ðŸ¤¯

I _actually_ got the idea from that flat earth documentary on Netflix. Behind
the Curve. No joke.

Why do flat earth people believe the earth is flat?

It's because the curve is soooooooo big that it looks flat.

That gave me an idea for a client project. They asked me to build a smooth
transition from a donut-shaped visualization to a bar chart shape.

No idea how to do that so I stalled for weeks by building everything else
first. Until one day I had an idea

You can _combine the two approaches to animation_ you learned in React for Data
Visualization. We talked about

1. **The game loop approach.** Borrows ideas from the gaming industry. Call
   `this.setState` 60 times per second and your React component animates.
   Wonderful.

2. **The D3 transition approach.** You take a React component, use props as a
   staging area, render from state, and use `componentDidMount` or `useEffect`
   to hand over rendering control to D3. D3 runs its transition, manipulates
   the DOM, then gives control back to React.

## A new approach to complex transitions

Now there's a 3rd approach. Something I never thought of before and it works
great.

Let's look at the transition again

Here's what happens behind the scenes to make it work:

1. A `<Donut>` component renders a bunch of `<Arc>`s
2. Each `<Arc>` takes care of its complex shape. Built from 3 different D3 arc
   generators
3. The whole thing is driven by D3's pie generator. It calculates start and end
   angles for individual arcs
4. Donut size is a function of radius. The bigger the radius, the bigger the
   donut.
5. As the radius increases from 728 to 29,905 the donut grows
6. And it moves down as fast as it grows. Without moving, it would fly off the
   screen and you'd never see it again
7. To keep the pie exactly 728px wide even though it's rendered on a 29,905px
   donut ... well you gotta calculate
   [the arc segment](https://planetcalc.com/1421/) and derive start and end
   angles from that

ðŸ¤¯

That's a lot of stuff.

And it's all driven by this code. The transition ðŸ‘‡

I call this on component mount. Could be on a click event or whatever. Starts a
custom tween transition with D3.

That lets D3 control the timing, the easing functions, keeping it smooth, all
of that. You don't have to think about any of it.

But instead of changing a DOM attribute, my tween calls `this.setState` on the
React component. Meaning it's _changing React state_ instead.

Since the donut bar chart knows how to render itself based on a radius ... well
... you can keep re-rendering at various radiuses and It Just Works.

Smooth transition by re-rendering the whole visualization 60 times per second.
Even though it's a super complex component. Lots of moving parts and
subcomponents.

Knowing everything that's going on behind the scenes I am _blown away_ by how
well it works.

React is magic.
