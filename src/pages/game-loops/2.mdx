Transitions like we used above work using interpolators. For numbers, an
interpolator is easy: A function that parametrizes changes to a single
argument.

```javascript
let i = d3.interpolateNumber(10, 20);
i(0.0); // 10
i(0.2); // 12
i(0.5); // 15
i(1.0); // 20
```

D3 can interpolate everything from numbers, to colors, and even objects or
strings. It does so by finding interpolatable parts of your argument and
manipulating them linearly depending on the `t` parameter.

But sometimes you need custom interpolators â€“ tweens.

Say you want to animate an arc shape. The path definition argument is a complex
string ðŸ‘‡

If that doesn't make sense, don't worry. I can't read it either.

When you transition a shape like that, funny things can happen. Sometimes arcs
fly around the screen, sometimes you get an error.

![Naively implemented transition. Notice the arcs change shape sometimes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/naive-transition-d3-pie.gif)

Notice the arc wobble.

## Tweens to the rescue

Luckily, D3 lets us define custom transitions called tweens. To smoothly
animate a piechart we can build an `arcTween`. Because piecharts are made of
arcs.

The idea is to move from transitioning path definitions, to transitioning
angles on a pie slice. We build a tween generator that takes some params and
returns a tweening function.

Tweening functions lie behind all transitions. They take an argument, `t`, and
return the value of your prop at a specific "time" of your transition. All
transitions you've used so far are built with tweens in the background.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/transition-sketch.png)

Our tween generator is going to need:

1.  `oldData`, the definition of our pie slice at the start of the transition
2.  `newData`, the definition of our pie slice that we want to tween towards
3.  `arc`, a
    [D3 arc generator](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#arcs)

Both `oldData` and `newData` come from a
[D3 pie generator](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#pies).
The `startAngle` and `endAngle` is what we're interested in.

Our `arcTween` function uses these to build a tween method that we then feed
into `attrTween`.

```javascript
// inspired from http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5100636
function arcTween(oldData, newData, arc) {
  const copy = { ...oldData };
  return function() {
    const interpolateStartAngle = d3.interpolate(
        oldData.startAngle,
        newData.startAngle
      ),
      interpolateEndAngle = d3.interpolate(oldData.endAngle, newData.endAngle);

    return function(t) {
      copy.startAngle = interpolateStartAngle(t);
      copy.endAngle = interpolateEndAngle(t);
      return arc(copy);
    };
  };
}
```

We make a `copy` of `oldData` so we don't change input data by accident, then
we return a function. This function creates two interpolators with
`d3.interpolate`. One for each angle.

Each interpolator starts from an `oldData` angle and moves towards a `newData`
angle.

This function then returns our interpolation function. It takes the argument
`t`, feeds it into our two interpolators, adjusts values on the `copy` object,
feeds that into the `arc` generator, and returns a new path definition.

You use it like this ðŸ‘‡

```javascript
// Arc.js
d3.select(this.refs.elem)
  .transition()
  .duration(80)
  .attrTween('d', arcTween(this.state.d, newProps.d, this.arc))
  .on('end', () =>
    this.setState({
      d: newProps.d,
      pathD: this.arc(newProps.d),
    })
  );
```

Select an element, a `<path>`, start a transition, make it last `80`
milliseconds, `attrTween` the path definition, `d`, attribute using the tween
returned from `arcTween`.
