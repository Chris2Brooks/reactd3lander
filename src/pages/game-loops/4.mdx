# Use tweens to drive state – hybrid animation

You now have all the ingredients for hybrid animation:

1. Custom tweens for tight transition control
2. State changes to drive animation

Let's bring them together ✌️

Red squares in a circle. Click one, they all fly out – bouncing like they're
tied to an elastic. Click again and the circle contracts.

Silly example, sure, but a useful technique. Same way the piechart to bar chart
transition worked.

It all happens in the `<HybridExample />` component.

```javascript
<HybridExample width={500} height={500} x={250} y={250} />
```

## <HybridExample />

Hybrid example is a functional component based on React Hooks. We use state for
the `radius`, an `angleScale` to position rectangles, and an `explode` function
to trigger the transition.

```javascript
const HybridExample = ({ x, y }) => {
  const [radius, setRadius] = useState(10);
  const N = 10;

  const angleScale = d3
    .scaleLinear()
    .domain([0, N])
    .range([0, Math.PI * 2]);

  const explode = () => {
    // transition
  };

  return (
    <g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y})`} onClick={explode}>
      {d3.range(N).map(i => (
        <Square
          x={Math.cos(angleScale(i)) * radius}
          y={Math.sin(angleScale(i)) * radius}
          key={i}
        />
      ))}
    </g>
  );
```

`useState` hook gives us initial `radius` of 10 and a `setRadius` function to
change it. `angleScale` translates linearly between a domain of 0 to N, and
angles in radians. 0 is 0, 2PI is a full circle.

We render squares the usual way:

- grouping element for positioning
- loop over a range of size `N`
- `<Square />` for each iteration
- use trigonometry to translate angles to `x` and `y` coordinates

Here's a helpful image, if you've forgotten your high school maths like I have

## Tween-driven state changes for animation

We used `onClick={explode}` to trigger the animation. Here's what that looks
like

```javascript
const explode = () => {
  const elastic = d3.easeElasticOut;
  elastic.amplitude(5);
  elastic.period(-0.3);

  d3.selection()
    .transition('radius-boom')
    .ease(elastic)
    .duration(1000)
    .tween('radius', () => {
      const radiusInt = d3.interpolate(radius, radius > 10 ? 10 : 60);
      return t => setRadius(radiusInt(t));
    });
};
```

`explode` starts by creating a new easing function – `elastic`. Elastic easing
is built into D3 and you can tweak its `amplitude` and `period`. Try different
values to see what happens.

We start a new virtual `d3.selection()`. Doesn't select anything, lets us run a
transition. Gotta give it a name though – `radius-boom`.

Then we specify the easing function, the duration, and create a custom tween.

```javascript
.tween("radius", () => {
	const radiusInt = d3.interpolate(radius, radius > 10 ? 10 : 60);
	return t => setRadius(radiusInt(t));
});
```

Our tween operates on the `radius`, which isn't even an SVG property. That's
just a logical name we use.

The tween itself uses an interpolator that goes from current radius – that's
the state – to either `10` or `60`. Small or large. That way we can use the
same tween both for growing and shrinking the circle.

We return a parametrized function that takes a `t` parameter and calls
`setRadius` with a value from our interpolator.

`setRadius` is the set state function we defined earlier with `useState`, which
means we update state on every tick of the transition animation. Update state,
component re-renders, you get smooth animation.

Works great ✌️
