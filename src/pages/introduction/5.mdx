# Buzzword soup explained

We're going to use some buzzwords in this course. Hell, we've used some already.
Most will get a thorough explanation further on, but let me give you a quick
rundown.

- **Babel**, a JavaScript transpiler that makes your code work on all browsers.
- **ECMAScript2015,16,17,18**, official names for JavaScript as new features
  come out every summer
- **ES5**, any JavaScript features that existed before June 2015
- **ES6** or **ES6+**, a common name for JavaScript as it exists past June 2015
- **fat arrows**, a new way to define functions in ES6 (`=>`)
- **Git**, a version control system. It's pretty popular, you probably know it
  ðŸ˜ƒ
- **H1B**, a popular type of work visa in the United States
- **JSX**, a language/syntax that lets you use `<a href="/example">` as a
  native part of JavaScript
- **Mustache**, a popular way to write HTML templates for JavaScript code. Uses
  `{{ ... }}` syntax.
- **npm**, most popular package manager for JavaScript libraries
- **props**, component properties set when rendering
- **state**, a local dictionary of values available in most components
- **functional components**, React components expressed as pure functions that
  take props and return markup
- **Webpack**, a module packager for JavaScript. Makes it more convenient to
  organize code into multiple files. Provides cool plugins.

## JSX

Our components are going to use JSX, a JavaScript syntax extension that lets us
treat XML-like data as normal code. You can use React without JSX, but JSX
makes Reactâ€™s full power easier to use.

The gist of JSX is that we can use any XML-like string just like it was part of
JavaScript. No Mustache or messy string concatenation necessary. Your functions
can return HTML, SVG, or XML.

For instance, code that renders one of our first examples â€“Â a color swatch
â€“Â looks like this:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<Colors width="400" />, document.getElementById("svg"))
```

Which compiles to:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Colors, { width: "400" }),
  document.querySelectorAll("svg")[0]
)
```

HTML code translates to `React.createElement` calls with attributes translated
into a property dictionary. The beauty of this approach is two-pronged: you can
use React components as if they were HTML tags, and HTML attributes can be
anything.

Youâ€™ll see that anything from a simple value to a function or an object works
equally well.
