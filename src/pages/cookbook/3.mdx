# Challenge

Christmas can be very expensive. Plot a line of how much americans think
they're spending on Christmas gifts over the years.

Today we built a little line chart with two axes and emoji datapoints. Hover an
emoji, get a line highlighting where it falls on the axis. Makes it easy to see
what happened when.

It's interesting to see how Christmas spending was on the rise and reached a
peak in 2007. Crashed in 2008 then started rising again. Great insight into the
US economy.

When times are good, people buy gifts. When times are bad, people don't. üßê

To build this linechart we used the same insight
[as yesterday](/christmas-trees/):

> Our data is static and never changes. We don't expect to change positions and
> size of our chart. That means we can cut some corners.

Once again we load data in `componentDidMount` using `d3.tsv` to parse a tab
separated values file. We feed the result array of objects into a `<Linechart>`
component.

## The basic linechart

Rendering a basic linechart was pretty quick: D3's got a line generator ü§ô

![Just the line](https://github.com/Swizec/datavizAdvent/raw/master/src/content/money-spent/justline.png)

That's an SVG `<path>` using `d3.line` to create the `d` shape attribute.
Wrapped into a React component it looks like this:

```javascript
class Linechart extends React.Component {
  x = d3
    .scalePoint()
    .domain(this.props.data.map(d => d.year))
    .range([0, this.props.width]);
  y = d3
    .scaleLinear()
    .domain([500, d3.max(this.props.data, d => d.avg_spend)])
    .range([this.props.height, 0]);

  line = d3
    .line()
    .x(d => this.x(d.year))
    .y(d => this.y(d.avg_spend));

  render() {
    const { x, y, data } = this.props;

    return (
      <g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y})`}>
        <Line d={this.line(data)} />
      </g>
    );
  }
}
```

We define two scales, `x` and `y` to help us translate between datapoints and
coordinates on the screen. Without those year 2018 would render 2018 pixels to
the right and that's too much.

`x` is a point scale, which like [yesterday's band scale](/christmas-trees/)
neatly arranges datapoints along a axis. Unlike a band scale it places them in
points at the middle of each ragne.

`y` is a boring old liear scale. Americans spend so much on gifts that we cut
off the domain at \$500. Makes the graph more readable and less tall.

Then we have the line generator. We define it with `d3.line`, tell it how to
get `x` and `y` coordinates with our scales and leave the rest as defaults.

Rendering is a matter of creating a wrapping `<g>` element to position our
graph and group all future additions. Inside, we render a styled `<Line>`
component and feed data into the line generator. That handles the rest.

You have to style lines or they come out invisible.

```javascript
const Line = styled.path`
  stroke-width: 3px;
  stroke: ${d3.color('green').brighter(1.5)};
  fill: none;
  stroke-linejoin: round;
`;
```

Give it a nice thickness, some light green color, remove the default black
fill, and make edges round. Lovely.

Note the `d3.color('green').brighter(1.5)` trick. We can use D3 to manipulate
colors üé®

## The axes

![Line with axes](https://github.com/Swizec/datavizAdvent/raw/master/src/content/money-spent/withaxes.png)

Because axes are a tricky best to build, we used a trick from
[React for Data Visualization](https://swizec1.teachable.com/p/react-for-data-visualization/) -
blackbox rendering.

That's when you take pure D3 code, wrap it in a React component, and let D3
handle the rendering. It's less efficient and doesn't scale as well, but
perfect for little things like this.

You can use my [d3blackbox](https://d3blackbox.com) library or make your own. I
used the lib üòõ

```javascript
const BottomAxis = d3blackbox((anchor, props) => {
  const axis = d3.axisBottom().scale(props.scale);
  d3.select(anchor.current).call(axis);
});

const LeftAxis = d3blackbox((anchor, props) => {
  const axis = d3.axisLeft().scale(props.scale);
  d3.select(anchor.current).call(axis);
});
```

`BottomAxis` and `LeftAxis` are both tiny. Two lines of code is all you need to
render a axis with D3.

1. Define the axis generator and give it a scale. We took it from props.
2. Select the element you want to render into and call your generator

`d3blackbox` handles the rest.

It's a higher order component (hook version called `useD3` is also in the
package). Takes your render function whatever it is, renders an anchor element,
positions it with `x` and `y` props, and makes sure to call your render
function on any update.

Quickest way to slap some D3 into some React üëå

## The üí∏ money emojis

How do you make a linechart more fun? You add money-flying-away emojis.

![Line with emojis](https://github.com/Swizec/datavizAdvent/raw/master/src/content/money-spent/moneymoji.png)

Interactive points on each edge of a linechart are pretty common after all.
Makes it easier to spot where the line breaks and shows actual data and where
it's just a line.

Adding emojis happens in a loop:

```javascript
{
  data.map(d => (
    <Money x={this.x(d.year)} y={this.y(d.avg_spend)}>
      üí∏
      <title>${d.avg_spend}</title>
    </Money>
  ));
}
```

Iterate through our data and render a styled `text` component called `Money`
for each datapoint. Using the same scales as we did for the linechart gives us
correct positioning out of the box.

One of the many benefits of scales üòâ

Styling deals with setting emoji font size and centering text on the `(x, y)`
anchor point.

```javascript
const Money = styled.text`
  font-size: 20px;
  cursor: pointer;
  text-anchor: middle;
  alignment-baseline: central;
`;
```

Oh and adding a `<title>` tag to our text creates a default browser tooltip.
Hover over an emoji for a few seconds and it shows some extra info.

## A highlight for easy reading

![A highlight to make life easier](https://github.com/Swizec/datavizAdvent/raw/master/src/content/money-spent/highlight.png)

Linecharts can be hard to read. With datapoints so far from the axes it can be
hard to see how everything lines up.

So we added a line to help our users out.

We keep track of what's currently highlighted in component state. When a value
exists, we use it to render a vertical line.

```javascript
class Linechart extends React.Component {
  state = {
    highlightYear: null
  };

  // ...

  highlight = year => this.setState({ highlightYear: year });
  unhighlight = () => this.setState({ highlightYear: null });

  // ...

  {highlightYear ? (
    <Highlight
      x1={this.x(highlightYear)}
      y1={-20}
      x2={this.x(highlightYear)}
      y2={height + 20}
    />
  ) : null}

  // ...

  <Money
    x={this.x(d.year)}
    y={this.y(d.avg_spend)}
    onMouseOver={() => this.highlight(d.year)}
    onMouseOut={this.unhighlight}
  >
```

Nothing too crazy.

We have a `highlightYear` state. This gets set on `onMouseOver` in the
`<Money>` emoji. On `onMouseOut`, we reset the highlight year back to `null`.

In the render method we then check whether `highlightYear` is set. If it is, we
render a vertical line that's styled to be thin and lightgrey. If it isn't, we
don't.

There's a lot we could do with that highlight to make it look smoother, but
time was up and this is good enough.
