Today's challenge is a perfect example of how
[chroma-js](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) automatically makes your dataviz
beautiful. Best magic trick I ever learned from Shirley Wu.

We used [Susie Lu's d3-legend](https://d3-legend.susielu.com/) for the color
legend, D3's stack layout to calculate coordinates for stacking those bar
charts, D3 axis for the axis, and the rest was React. Similar code to the bar
chart in [Christmas movies at the box office](/christmas-movies/).

## Load the data

We begin once more by loading the data. If you've been following along so far,
this code will look familiar.

```javascript
  componentDidMount() {
    d3.tsv("/data.tsv", d => ({
      category: d.category,
      young: Number(d.young),
      mid: Number(d.mid),
      old: Number(d.old)
    })).then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }
```

`d3.tsv` loads our tab separated values file with data, a parsing function
turns each line into nice objects we can use, and then we save it into
component local state.

## An axis and a legend

Building axes and legends from scratch is not hard, but it is fiddly and time
consuming and fraught with tiny little traps for you to fall into. No time for
that on a daily challenge!

[d3blackbox](https://d3blackbox.com) to the rescue! &lt;supermanemoji>

```javascript
const VerticalAxis = d3blackbox((anchor, props) => {
  const axis = d3.axisLeft().scale(props.scale);
  d3.select(anchor.current).call(axis);
});

const Legend = d3blackbox((anchor, props) => {
  d3.select(anchor.current).call(
    legend
      .legendColor()
      .scale(props.scale)
      .title('Age group')
  );
});
```

Here you can see just how flexible the blackbox rendering approach I teach in
[React for Data Visualization](https://swizec1.teachable.com/p/react-for-data-visualization)
can be. You can take just about any D3 code and turn it into a React component.

Means you don't have to write your own fiddly stuff üëå

`d3blackbox` ensures our render functions are called on every component render
and creates a positionable grouping, `<g>`, SVG element for us to move around.

## Each category's barchart

You can think a stacked bar chart as a series of barcharts. Each category gets
its own.

```javascript
const BarChart = ({ entries, y, width, marginLeft, color }) => (
  <React.Fragment>
    {entries.map(([min, max], i) => (
      <rect
        x={marginLeft + width(min)}
        width={width(max) - width(min)}
        y={y(y.domain()[i])}
        height={y.bandwidth()}
        key={y.domain()[i]}
        fill={color}
      >
        <title>
          {min}, {max}
        </title>
      </rect>
    ))}
  </React.Fragment>
);
```

These barchart subcomponents are fully controled components. They help us clean
up the rendering and don't need any logic of their own.

Takes a list of `entries` to render, a `y` scale for vertical positioning, a
`width` scale to calculate widths, some margin on the left for the big axis,
and a `color` to use.

Renders a React Fragment with a bunch of rectangles. Loop over the entries,
return a positioned rectangle for each.

Our entries are pairs of `min` and `max` values as calculated by the stack
layout. We use them to decide the horizontal, `x` position of our rectangle,
and its width. Using the `width` scale both times. That takes care of proper
sizing for us.

That `key` prop is a little funny though.

The `y` scale is an ordinal scale. Its domain is a list of categories, which
means we can get the name of each bar's category by picking the right index out
of that array. Perfect for identifying our elements :)

## A stack chart built with React and D3

Here's how all of that ties together üëá

```javascript
class StackChart extends React.Component {
  y = d3
    .scaleBand()
    .domain(this.props.data.map(d => d.category))
    .range([0, this.props.height])
    .paddingInner(0.1);
  stack = d3.stack().keys(['young', 'mid', 'old']);
  color = chroma.brewer.pastel1;
  colorScale = d3
    .scaleOrdinal()
    .domain(['üßí 18 to 29 years', 'üôç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 30 to 59 years', 'üßì 60 years or older'])
    .range(this.color);

  render() {
    const { data } = this.props;

    const stack = this.stack(data);

    const width = d3
      .scaleLinear()
      .domain([0, d3.max(stack[2], d => d[1])])
      .range([0, 400]);

    return (
      <g>
        <VerticalAxis scale={this.y} x={220} y={0} />
        {this.stack(data).map((entries, i) => (
          <BarChart
            entries={entries}
            y={this.y}
            key={i}
            marginLeft={223}
            color={this.color[i]}
            width={width}
          />
        ))}
        <Legend scale={this.colorScale} x={500} y={this.props.height - 100} />
      </g>
    );
  }
}
```

Okay that's a longer code snippet üòÖ

### D3 setup

In the beginning, we have some D3 objects.

1. A `y` band scale. Handles vertical positioning, sizing, spacing, and all
2. A `stack` generator with hardcoded keys. We know what we want and there's no
   need to be fancy
3. A `color` list. Chroma's `brewer.pastel1` looked Best
4. A `colorScale` with a more verbose domain and our list of colors as the
   range

Having a separate list of colors and color scale is important. Our individual
bars want a specific color, our legend wants a color scale. They use different
domains and unifying them would be fiddly. Easier to keep apart.

### render

We do a little cheating in our `render` method. That `stack` should be
generated in a `componentDidUpdate` of some sort and so should the `width`
linear scale.

But our data is small so it's okay to recalculate all this every time.

The `stack` generator creates a list of lists of entries. 3 lists, one for each
category (age group). Each list contains pairs of numbers representing how they
should stack.

Like this

```
[
  [[0, 5], [0, 10]],
  [[5, 7], [10, 16]],
  [[13, 20], [26, 31]]
]
```

Entries in the first list all begin at `0`. Second list begins where the
previous list ends. Third list begins where the second list ended. Stacking up
as far as you need.

Your job is then to take these numbers, feed them into some sort of scale to
help with sizing, and render.

That was our `<BarChart>` sub component up above. It takes each list, feeds its
values into a `width` scale, and renders.

Making sure we render 3 of them, one for each age group, is this part:

```javascript
return (
  <g>
    <VerticalAxis scale={this.y} x={220} y={0} />
    {stack.map((entries, i) => (
      <BarChart
        entries={entries}
        y={this.y}
        key={i}
        marginLeft={223}
        color={this.color[i]}
        width={width}
      />
    ))}
    <Legend scale={this.colorScale} x={500} y={this.props.height - 100} />
  </g>
);
```

Starts by rendering an axis, followed by a loop through our stack, rendering a
`<BarChart>` for each, and then the `<Legend>` component neatly positioned to
look good.

A beautiful chart pops out.
