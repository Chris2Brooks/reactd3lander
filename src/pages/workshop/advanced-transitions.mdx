# Advanced transitions

This is where shit gets fun.

You can drive React state changes with D3 transitions. ðŸ¤¯

The idea is that:

1. Your components are a pure representation of state+props
2. Change state lots and components animate
3. D3 transitions are a javascript game loop inside
4. Use the transition to change state, drive renders

You can build stuff like this:

But we're going to do something simpler ðŸ‘‰ a bouncy scatterplot.

Take your final scatterplot from before and make its size transition into smaller dimensions on click.

You'll need to:

1. Change the click handling function
2. Use a custom `.tween` transition to hook into D3's game loop
3. Use that tween to update dimension state

Here are some tips:

- `.tween()` calls a function that should return a parametrized function
- that function will get a `t` which says _"We're on this frame of animation"_
- you can use `d3.interpolate` to parametrize between 2 values
- your parametrized method can update state to trigger renders ðŸ˜‰

Here's my final solution, I'll walk you through after you give it a shot:
