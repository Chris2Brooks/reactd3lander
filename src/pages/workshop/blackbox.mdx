# Blackbox components with hooks

Blackbox components wrap any D3 code in React. They're called blackbox because React can't see inside and can't help you with rendering

Perfect for small components like axes (which are tedious to build yourself) and

Use this D3 code for an axis to create a simple `<Axis>` component.

```javascript
const scale = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 10]).range([0, 200])
const axis = d3.axisBottom(scale)
```

You'll need the `useRef` hook to reference a rendered `<g>` element and the `useEffect` hook to trigger D3 rendering when the component changes.

Try solving it without looking at my solution.

## my useD3 hook for blackbox components

Even better than doing it yourself is using the ready-made `useD3` hook I opensourced for you :)

Read the full docs at [d3blackbox.com](https://d3blackbox.com/)

It works as a combination of `useRef` and `useEffect`. Hooks into component
re-renders, gives you control of the anchor element, and re-runs your D3 render
function on every component render.

You use it like this:

```javascript
import { useD3 } from "d3blackbox"
function renderSomeD3(anchor) {
  d3.select(anchor)
  // ...
}

const MyD3Component = ({ x, y }) => {
  const refAnchor = useD3((anchor) => renderSomeD3(anchor))
  return <g ref={refAnchor} transform={`translate(${x}, ${y})`} />
}
```

You'll see how this works in more detail when we build the big example project. We'll use `useD3` to build axes.

Here's how the above example looks when you use `useD3` ✌️

# Exercise

Now try using the `useD3` hook to create a barchart component based on the earlier D3 example.

You can get the code by right-click + view source [on this link here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/mbostock/3885304/raw/a91f37f5f4b43269df3dbabcda0090310c05285d/index.html)

This example was written with d3v4 so you'll have to change `d3.tsv()` to return `data` as a promise. I've prepared the dataset and styling for you :)
