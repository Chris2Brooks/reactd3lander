When React came on the scene it made a big splash with its DOM diffing engine. You could build UI just like you'd build a game üòç

No more fiddly work with figuring out the difference between one frame and another. Change state, let React handle the rest.

It was amazing.

I built a simple Space Invaders clone and gave my first big tech talk in San Francisco about it.

Nowadays that's nothing special. Every framework can do it. Oh you can change state, re-render, and it all just works?

Boooooring.

But a lot of people don't realize that you can use this trick for animation. Change state 60 times per second and magic happens.

That's how video games work.

You can think of a video game as a mutating state tree. Each action adds some change to the tree. The game then engine re-renders your frame as a pure representation of that state.

Very much like React.

Your components render from state and props. Change those and the components re-render. Change them fast enough and they animate.

## Animating with Hooks and state

Here's how this game loop approach to animation works in action. An animated spiral.

Silly example I know. We're focusing on the technique üòõ

Frame mismatch between gif and UI makes it look jittery. Silky smooth if you click through I promise.

### Here's how it works

We have a `<Spiral>` component that's rendered inside an SVG element.

```javascript
<svg width="400" height="400">
  <Spiral cx={200} cy={150} maxR={75} />
</svg>
```

Takes a center-x, center-y, and max radius as props.

The component uses those to render a `<circle>` element with some colors.

```javascript
return (
  <g transform={`translate(${cx}, ${cy})`}>
    <circle
      cx={x}
      cy={y}
      r={10}
      fill={color}
      stroke={borderColor}
      strokeWidth={2}
    />
  </g>
)
```

The grouping `<g>` elements moves our coordinate system to `cx, cy` and the `<circle>` renders a circle. Attributes define its coordinates and color.

We get those attributes with high school trigonometry.

```javascript
const x = Math.cos((angle * Math.PI) / 180) * radius.r
const y = Math.sin((angle * Math.PI) / 180) * radius.r
const color = d3.interpolateRdBu(angle / 360)
const borderColor = d3.interpolateRdBu((360 - angle) / 360)
```

X is the cosine of `angle` in radians multiplied with current radius. Y is the sine.

D3 helps us get a new color for every angle. Makes it flashy.

### The game loop

All of that won't make an animation. It just makes a circle.

What you need next is the game loop. It comes in 3 parts.

1. The state
2. The animation tick method
3. The timer

**The state** defines the 2 parameters we'll change with each tick of the animation.

```javascript
// using R and V for radius helps us invert the spiral at 0
const [radius, setRadius] = useState({ r: maxR, v: -(maxR / 360) })
const [angle, setAngle] = useState(0)
```

The `radius` state has two parts. The current radius, `r`, and the current velocity, `v`. This helps us change between making it bigger or smaller when we hit an edge.

The `angle` state holds the current angle. Feed it into sine and cosine to get coordinates.

**The animation tick method** runs about 60 times per second and manipulates this state.

```javascript
function tickAnimation() {
  // run angle in a circle
  // adjust +2 to speed up and fit entire animation in a certain time
  setAngle((angle) => (angle + 2) % 360)
  setRadius((radius) => {
    let { r, v } = radius
    r += v

    // invert movement direction at 0 and maxR
    if (r < 0) {
      v = +(maxR / 360)
    } else if (r > maxR) {
      v = -(maxR / 360)
    }

    return { r, v }
  })
}
```

Change angle with a modus of 360 to run in a circle, change radius inward or outward depending on velocity. Invert velocity when you reach different limits.

**The timer** triggers our `tickAnimation` function to drive the animation.

```javascript
// start game loop timer on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const t = d3.timer(tickAnimation)
  return () => t.stop()
}, [])
```

The `useEffect` hook runs on mount, starts a `d3.timer` which calls our method about 60 times per second, and cleans up with a `stop()`. Ensures we don't run the animation after component unmounts.

You can think of D3 timer as a more reliable `setInterval` ‚úåÔ∏è

And voila, an animated spiral that looks jittery on a gif and wonderful in real life.

## How this approach scales

The game loop approach is fantastic because it gives you lots of power. You can do whatever you want, as intricate as you want.

The game loop approach sucks because it gives you lots of power and lets you do whatever you want.

üòÖ

Oftentimes you don't want this much power. You want something simpler and easy to use. Less power, more magic.

That's where transitions come in. Let D3 handle the details.
