Yeah turns out generative art is really hard. And Mondrian did it manually.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/9czz3FL.gif)](https://mondrian-generator.swizec-react-dataviz.now.sh/)

[Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) was a Dutch
painter famous for his style of grids with basic squares and black lines. So
famous in fact, Google finds him as
["squares art guy"](https://www.google.com/search?q=squares+art+guy&oq=squares+art+guy&aqs=chrome..69i57.3689j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

The signature style grew out of his earlier cubist works seeking a universal
beauty understood by a all humans.

So I figured what better way to experiment with
[D3 treemaps](https://observablehq.com/@d3/treemap) than to pay an homage to
this great artist.

## What is a treemap anyway?

[![A treemap built with D3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/master/img/treemap.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-hierarchy)

> Introduced by Ben Shneiderman in 1991, a treemap recursively subdivides area
> into rectangles according to each node‚Äôs associated value.

In other words, a treemap takes a rectangle and packs it with smaller
rectangles based on a tiling algorithm. Each rectangle's area is proportional
to the value it represents.

Treemaps are most often used for presenting budgets and other relative sizes.
Like in this interactive
[example of a government budget from 2016](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/interactive-budget).

![](https://i.imgur.com/YzOsWfp.png)

You can see at a glance most of the money goes to social security, then health
care, which is split between medicaid, children's health, etc.

Treemaps are great for recursive data like that.

## Using a D3 treemap to generate art with React

We wanted to play with treemaps per a reader's request, but couldn't find an
interesting dataset to visualize. _Generating_ data was the solution.
Parametrizing it with sliders, pure icing on the cake.

Also I was curious how close we can get :)

3 pieces have to work together to produce an interactive piece of art:

1. A recursive rendering component
2. A function that generates treemappable data
3. Sliders that control inputs to the function

### A recursive rendering component

Treemaps are recursive square subdivisions. They come with a bunch of tiling
algorithms, the most visually stunning of which is the
[squarified treemaps](https://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/stm.pdf) algorithm
described in 2000 by Dutch researchers.

What is it with Dutch people and neat squares ü§î

While beautiful, the squarified treemaps algorithm did not look like a
Mondrian.

![Squarified treemap of our Mondrian function](https://i.imgur.com/sw6pO2r.png)

Subtle difference, I know, but squarified treemaps are based on the
[golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and Piet Mondrian's
art does not look like that. We used the `d3.treemapBinary` algorithm instead.
It aims to create a balanced binary tree.

#### main `<Mondrian>` component

```javascript
// src/Mondrian.js

const Mondrian = ({ x, y, width, height, data }) => {
  const treemap = d3
    .treemap()
    .size([width, height])
    .padding(5)
    .tile(d3.treemapBinary)

  const root = treemap(
    hierarchy(data)
      .sum(d => d.value)
      .sort((a, b) => 0.5 - Math.random())
  )

  return (
    <g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y})`}>
      <MondrianRectangle node={root} />
    </g>
  )
}
```

The `<Mondrian>` component takes some props and instantiates a new treemap
generator. We could've wrapped this in a `useMemo` call for better performance,
but it seemed fast enough.

We set the treemap's `size()` from width and height props, a guessed
`padding()` of 5 pixels, and a tiling algorithm.

This creates a `treemap()` generator ‚Äì¬†a method that takes data and returns
that same data transformed with values used for rendering.

The generator takes a [d3-hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy), which
is a particular data format shared by all hierarchical rendering generators in
the D3 suite. Rather than build it ourselves, we feed our source data into the
`hierarchy()` method. That cleans it up for us ‚úåÔ∏è

We need the `sum()` method to tell the hierarchy how to sum up the values of
our squares, and we use random sorting because that produced nicer results.

#### a `<MondrianRectangle>` component for each square

We render each level of the resulting treemap with a `<MondrianRectangle>`
component.

```javascript
// src/Mondrian.js

const MondrianRectangle = ({ node }) => {
  const { x0, y0, x1, y1, children } = node,
    width = x1 - x0,
    height = y1 - y0;

  return (
    <>
      <rect
        x={x0}
        y={y0}
        width={width}
        height={height}
        style={
          fill: node.data.color,
          stroke: "black",
          strokeWidth: 5
        }
        onClick={() => alert(`This node is ${node.data.color}`)}
      />
      {children &&
        children.map((node, i) => <MondrianRectangle node={node} key={i} />)}
    </>
  );
};
```

Each rectangle gets a `node` prop with a bunch of useful properties.

- `x0, y0` defines the top left corner
- `x1, y1` is the bottom right corner
- `children` are the child nodes from our hierarchy

We render an SVG `<rect>` component as the square representing _this_ node. Its
children we render by looping through the `children` array and recursively
rendering a `<MondrianRectangle>` component for each.

The `onClick` is there just to show how you might make these interactive :)

> You can use this same principle to render any data with a treemap.

### A Mondrian data generator method

We moved the generative art piece into a custom `useMondrianGenerator` hook.
Keeps our code cleaner üòå

```javascript
// src/App.js

let mondrian = useMondrianGenerator({
  redRatio,
  yellowRatio,
  blueRatio,
  blackRatio,
  subdivisions,
  maxDepth,
})
```

The method takes a bunch of arguments that act as weights on randomly generated
parameters. Ideally we'd create a stable method that always produces the same
result for the same inputs, but that proved difficult.

As mentioned earlier, generative art is _hard_ so this method is gnarly. üòá

#### Weighed random color generator

We start with a weighed random generator.

```javascript
// src/useMondrianGenerator.js

// Create weighted probability distribution to pick a random color for a square
const createColor = ({ redRatio, blueRatio, yellowRatio, blackRatio }) => {
  const probabilitySpace = [
    ...new Array(redRatio * 10).fill('red'),
    ...new Array(blueRatio * 10).fill('blue'),
    ...new Array(yellowRatio * 10).fill('yellow'),
    ...new Array(blackRatio * 10).fill('black'),
    ...new Array(
      redRatio * 10 + blueRatio * 10 + yellowRatio * 10 + blackRatio * 10
    ).fill('#fffaf1'),
  ]

  return d3.shuffle(probabilitySpace)[0]
}
```

`createColor` picks a color to use for each square. It takes desired ratios of
different colors and uses a trick I discovered in college. There are probably
better ways to create a [weighed random method, but this works well and is
something I can understand.

You create an array with the amount of values proportional to the probabilities
you want. If you want `red` to be twice as likely as `blue`, you'd use an array
like `[red, red, blue]`.

Pick a random element from that array and you get values based on
probabilities.

The result is a `createColor` method that returns colors in the correct ratio
without knowing context of what's already been picked and what hasn't. ‚úåÔ∏è

#### generating mondrians

The `useMondrianGenerator` hook itself is pretty long. I'll explain in code
comments so it's easier to follow along :)

```javascript
// src/useMondrianGenerator.js

// Takes inputs and spits out mondrians
function useMondrianGenerator({
  redRatio,
  yellowRatio,
  blueRatio,
  blackRatio,
  subdivisions,
  maxDepth,
}) {
  // useMemo helps us avoid recalculating this all the time
  // saves computing resources and makes the art look more stable
  let mondrian = useMemo(() => {
    // calculation is wrapped in a method so we can use recursion
    // each level gets the current "value" that is evenly split amongst children
    // we use depth to decide when to stop
    const generateMondrian = ({ value, depth = 0 }) => {
      // each level gets a random number of children based on the subdivisions argument
      const N = Math.round(1 + Math.random() * (subdivisions * 10 - depth))

      // each node contains:
      // its value, used by treemaps for layouting
      // its color, used by <MondrianRectangle> for the color
      // its children, recursively generated based on the number of children
      return {
        value,
        color: createColor({
          redRatio,
          yellowRatio,
          blueRatio,
          blackRatio,
        }),
        children:
          // this check helps us stop when we need to
          // d3.range generates an empty array of length N that we map over to create children
          depth < maxDepth * 5
            ? d3.range(N).map(_ =>
                generateMondrian({
                  value: value / N,
                  depth: depth + 1,
                })
              )
            : null,
      }
    }

    // kick off the recursive process with a value of 100
    return generateMondrian({
      value: 100,
    })
    // regenerate the base data when max depth or rate of subdivisions change
  }, [maxDepth, subdivisions])

  // Iterate through all children and update colors when called
  const updateColors = node => ({
    ...node,
    color: createColor({
      redRatio,
      yellowRatio,
      blueRatio,
      blackRatio,
    }),
    children: node.children ? node.children.map(updateColors) : null,
  })

  // useMemo again helps with stability
  // We update colors in our dataset whenever those ratios change
  // depending on subdivisions and maxDepth allows the data update from that earlier useMemo to propagate
  mondrian = useMemo(() => updateColors(mondrian), [
    redRatio,
    yellowRatio,
    blueRatio,
    blackRatio,
    subdivisions,
    maxDepth,
  ])

  return mondrian
}
```

And that creates mondrian datasets based on inputs. Now we just need the
inputs.

### Sliders for function inputs

Thanks to React Hooks, our sliders were pretty easy to implement. Each controls
a ratio for a certain value fed into a random data generation method.

Take the slider that controls the ratio of red squares for example.

It starts life as a piece of state in the `<App>` component.

```javascript
// src/App.js

const [redRatio, setRedRatio] = useState(0.2)
```

`redRatio` is the value, `setRedRatio` is the value setter, `0.2` is the
initial value.

Render the slider as a `<Range>` component.

```javascript
// src/App.js

<Range name="red" value={redRatio} onChange={setRedRatio} />
```

Value comes from our state, update state on change.

The `<Range>` component itself looks like this:

```javascript
// src/App.js

const Range = ({ name, value, onChange }) => {
  return (
    <div style={ display: "inline-block" }>
      {name}
      <br />
      <input
        type="range"
        name={name}
        min={0}
        max={1}
        step={0.1}
        value={value}
        onChange={event => onChange(Number(event.target.value))}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

HTML has built-in sliders so we don't have to reinvent the wheel. Render an
input, give it a `type="range"`, set value from our prop, and parse the event
value in `onChange` before feeding it back to `setRedRange` with our callback.

Now each time you move that slider, it triggers a re-render, which generates a
new Mondrian from the data.

## Conclusion

In conclusion: generative art is hard, Piet Mondrian was brillianter than he
seems, and D3 treemaps are great fun.

Hope you enjoyed this as much as I did :)
