          You can avoid all that and learn how to build scalable and reusable
          dataviz components your whole team <em>and</em> future you can
          understand with <strong>React for Data Visualization</strong>.

          Get the confidence you need to excel and build anything you can

          React is the biggest revolution in JavaScript programming since
          jQuery hit the scene 10 years ago, and D3 is unlike anything you've
          seen before.
        </p>

        <p>
          The problem comes from how most of us first learn to code. &quot;It's
          like a cooking recipe&quot;, teachers will say.
        </p>

        <p>
          Take a bell pepper and cut it up. Then sprinkle some salt and pepper,
          add olive oil, and voila: you have a refreshing salad. A very simple
          salad with a single ingredient, but a salad nonetheless. You can
          follow along and eventually you will understand what the code does.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's imperative programming. It reads as a series of steps. How to
          do something.
        </p>

        <p>
          React and D3 are declarative. You don't write <em>How</em> you want
          your code to work, you write <em>What</em> you want to achieve. Your
          bell pepper salad recipe looks more like this:{' '}
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code className="language-javascript">
            {`
  <Salad>
    <Oil />
    <BellPepper cut salted />
  </Salad>
  `}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          You look at that and you know it's a salad. It involves oil and bell
          peppers. You don't have to read the steps to know the result. The
          recipe declares what it's making.
        </p>

        <p>
          Declarative code makes your project cleaner and easier to maintain.
          Means more time creating value for your users and clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          But learning how to think declaratively is hard. It starts like
          voodoo magic. We've all been there. It still hurts my brain
          sometimes.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's why <strong>React for Data Visualization</strong> starts with
          small building blocks then builds up to entire dashboards. Learn the
          basics in about an hour, then dive as deep as you want
