                    <p>
                        React+D3 started as a bet in April 2015. A friend wanted
                        to learn React and challenged me to publish a book. A
                        month later React+D3 launched with 79 pages of hard
                        earned knowledge.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In April 2016 it became <strong>React+D3</strong> ES6.
                        117 pages and growing beyond a single big project it was
                        a huge success. I kept going, started live streaming,
                        and publishing videos on YouTube.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        <strong>React+D3v4 is the best book</strong>
                        I've ever written. 249 pages, many examples, much code
                        to play with. It's designed like a step-by-step course
                        so you can{" "}
                        <strong>follow along without breaking a sweat.</strong>

                    <p>
                        I based React+D3v4 on{" "}
                        <strong>20 years of experience</strong> with learning
                        how to code <strong>on my own</strong>, reading blogs
                        and articles, listening to <strong>professors</strong>,
                        and <strong>working with mentors</strong>. Yes, that
                        means I wrote my{" "}
                        <strong>first program when I was 9</strong>. I've been
