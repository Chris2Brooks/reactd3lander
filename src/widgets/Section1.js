                So you want to build a beautiful data viz. You've got data
                burning a hole through your pocket, an idea for a juicy story,
                and your boss or client are waiting for results.
            </p>

            <p>
                You want something that looks great, works in the browser,
                performs on mobile, lets users interact with their data, syncs
                across an entire dashboard, and works as building blocks for
                future projects.

            <p>Cool ... now what?</p>

            <p>
                I remember building my first data visualization back in 2012.
                Visualized my coding habits from GitHub data.

            <h2>
                &quot;I've tried D3 in the past, found it powerful but a bit
                confusing to use&quot;
            </h2>

            <p>
                Dynamic data visualization for the web is a pain in the ass you
                see. Harder than it looks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yeah sure anyone can build a chart in google docs but that's not
                what you're after is it? You can't build a <em>product</em> on
                top of google sheets. You definitely can't feed in dynamic data
                from an API, personalized to the user, and let them navigate and
                explore.
            </p>

            <p>
                You've heard people build these amazing things with D3. The New
                York Times uses it, The Guardian does, so do Netflix, Uber,
                23andMe, Visa, Walmart, and many others. I know because they've
                been to my workshops ;)
            </p>

            <p>
                You hunt the web for examples and omaigod what is this!? How the
                hell is D3 doing that? ðŸ˜³
            </p>

                That's a bar chart by the way. You'd never guess just looking at
                the code. I've been doing this for years and I still have to
                simulate D3 examples in my mind to figure out how they work.
            </p>

            <p>
                You decide that's too much and look for a library. Something
                easy you can use to finish real quick.
            </p>

            <p>
                You find a bunch of libraries built on top of D3. Some even
                combine React and D3. Perfect for any modern web project!
            </p>

            <p>
                You cobble something together and call it a day. Job well done.

                Your boss takes one look and says{" "}

            <p>Errr ...</p>

            <p>
                Okay okay, some CSS, a little trickery, tweak the arguments and
                you got dis. Crisis averted!

            <p>
                You used a library and those always break down when you start
                customizing stuff. At some point you spend more time fighting
                the library than building your data visualization.

            <p>Time to learn D3.</p>

                &quot;There are way too many shitty resources on D3 floating
                around on the interwebs, and frankly, the D3 docs are shit too
                because they're WAY TOO COMPLICATED AND VERBOSE for someone that
                just wants to understand how it works and get shit done.&quot;
            </h2>

            <p>
                You can do what everyone else does: Copy paste some examples
                that look like what you're building, make some tweaks, and hope
                for the best.
            </p>

            <p>
                You're not proud of your code and you're not quite sure how it
                works, but it works and that's what matters. Right?
            </p>

            <p>
                Yep that works until you have to change something. Or explain
                how it works to another engineer on your team so they can fix a
                bug.
            </p>

            <p>
                God forbid you come back 6 months later looking to fix a thing
                or add a feature. Time to re-study all of that code and figure
                out how it works.
