##How it works ⚙️

This donut chart build was short and sweet. D3 has all the ingredients we need, Chroma's got the colors, d3-svg-legend has nice legend stuff. Oh and we used it as an excuse to update my [d3blackbox](https://d3blackbox.com) library so it actually exports the hooks version.

Thought it did, had it in the docs, published version didn't have it. 20 day old issue report on GitHub. Oops 😅

You can see data loading in the Codesandbox above. Here's the fun stuff

## React and D3 pie chart tutorial with React hooks

Pie charts and donut charts are the same. If there's a hole in the middle it's a donut, otherwise it's a pie. You should always make donuts because donuts are delicious and easier to read due to intricacies around area size perception.

Our code fits in a functional React component

```javascript
const TreeDonut = ({ data, x, y, r }) => {}
```

Takes `data`, `x,y` coordinates for positioning, and `r` for the total radius.

We begin with a bunch of D3 objects. Scales, pie generators, things like that.

```javascript
const pie = d3.pie().value(d => d.percentage)
const arc = d3
  .arc()
  .innerRadius(90)
  .outerRadius(r)
  .padAngle(0.01)
const color = chroma.brewer.set1
const colorScale = d3
  .scaleOrdinal()
  .domain(data.map(d => d.answer))
  .range(color)
```

Here's what they do:

1. The `d3.pie()` generator takes data and returns everything you need to create a pie chart. Start and end angles of each slice and a few extras.
2. The `d3.arc()` generator creates path definitions for pie slices. We define inner and outer radiuses and add some padding.
3. We take the `color` list from one of Chroma's pre-defined colors.
4. We'll use `colorScale` for the legend. Maps answers from our dataset to their colors

Next thing we need is some state for the overlay effect. It says which slice is currently selected.

```javascript
const [selected, setSelected] = useState(null)
```

Hooks make this way too easy. 😛 We'll use `setSelected` to set the value and store it in `selected`.

Then we render it all with a loop.

```javascript
return (
  <g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y})`}>
    {pie(data).map(d => (
      <path
        d={arc
          .outerRadius(selected === d.index ? r + 10 : r)
          .innerRadius(selected === d.index ? 85 : 90)(d)}
        fill={color[d.index]}
        onMouseOver={() => setSelected(d.index)}
        onMouseOut={() => setSelected(null)}
      />
    ))}
    <Legend x={r} y={r} colorScale={colorScale} />
  </g>
)
```

A grouping element positions our piechart from the center out.

Inside that group, we iterate over the output of our `pie()` generator and render a `<path>` for each entry. Its shape comes from the `arc` generator.

We update inner and outer radius on the fly depending on whether the current slice is highlighted. This creates the become-bigger-on-mouse-over effect. We drive it with mouse event callbacks and the `setSelected` method.

`setSelected` stores the current selected index in `selected`. This triggers a re-render. The selected slice shows as bigger.

Perfect 👌

## PS: The legend component with hooks is a piece of cake

`d3-svg-legend` does it all for us. We use `useD3` from my d3blackbox to make it work.

```javascript
const Legend = function({ x, y, colorScale }) {
  const ref = useD3(anchor => {
    d3.select(anchor).call(d3legend.legendColor().scale(colorScale))
  })

  return <g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y})`} ref={ref} />
}
```

Lets us render any D3 code into an anchor element and wrap it in a React component. Behind the scenes `useD3` is a combination of `useRef` and `useEffect`.

Enjoy ✌️
